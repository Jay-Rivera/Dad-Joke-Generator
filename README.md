# Dad-Joke-Generator

## Overview

---

This project is part of the Codecademy Fullstack Course.

** The Challenge **
This will be a Javascript project that we have to create on our own. This will only be in JS and we will have to practice using Git and Github.

### What the Project will do

I will be creating a Dad Joke Generator. When a user runs the Javascript code, a new dad joke should print.
